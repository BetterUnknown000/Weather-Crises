# Weather-Crises
CMPSC 463 --- Project 2

# Weather Pattern Visualizer
Our project intends to utilize clustering algorithms such as K-means and a Weighted Scoring Model with dynamic datasets provided by OpenMeteo and the National Weather Service (NWS). The goal of our project is to produce a weather alert system using these algorithms, one that will be able to identify the location of storms and other weather events through the use of our clustering algorithm, and create a prioritized emergency alert order using our weighted scoring model.
